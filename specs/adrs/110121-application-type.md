# Decision 1: Application Type

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Team Decision
* Date: 2021-11-01

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide which type of device users would be mostly using the application on, and design our application based on that.

## Considered Options

* Mobile Application
* Desktop Application

## Decision Outcome

We will design a mobile-first application since we assume our target users would be using the application in the kitchen. Especially when people are cooking, it will be more convenient for people to use their mobile phones alongside the step-by-step feature we have.

We will also have support for desktop using the components we built for mobile.
