## Project Description
Our team will design a recipe management application.

## Setup Instructions
1. ```git clone https://github.com/12DaysOfCoding/WeTheFoodies.git```
2. Get [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have.
3. In the root dir of this project, run `npm install`. This will install [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
4. To run the linter, do `npm run lint`. Only unfixable problems will be reported.
5. To run unit tests, `npm run test`
6. To run e2e tests, `npm run e2e`

## Contribution
1. Make changes in the folder called `source`, more specifically, the `html` files are placed directly inside the `source` while the `css` and `js` files are placed inside `assets/style` and `assets/scripts` respectively.
2. Run `npm run lint` to lint the code up to standard.
3. Follow the [testing writeup](#testing), add more unit and end to end tests to the corresponding folder (highly recommended).
4. Run `npm run test` to execute unit tests. Fix any issue.
5. Run `npm run e2e` to execute end to end test. Fix any issue.
6. Commit all changes and push.
7. Make a pull request and fill out the template. Request some reviews.
8. Make sure all status checks are passed before merging

## Testing
* We are using a combination of [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) to run tests.
* Jest is for unit tests and puppeteer is for end to end tests.
* Note there is a folder call `/tests` in the root dir. Within this folder, you have one folder called `unit` and another called `e2e`. Each contains an example of how to write a simple test.

## [Documentation](https://cse110-fa21-group30.github.io/cse110-fa21-group30/)
This is auto generated by [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html)
You need to follow their guideline (preceding functions with a line or block comment) in order for the documentation to show up.
Ex.
```
/**
 * returns the sum of a and b
 * @param {int} a - first number
 * @param {int} b - second number
 */
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

## Linting 
- Ideally, make sure to lint locally before make the pull request. But it's fine to just push to repo, since CI pipeline would lint again just in case. 
- We are using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as linter. 
- Only files within the "src" directory would be linted. 

## Quality analysis automation
- We are using [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) to analysis the quality of the source code. 
- For each pull request, the CI/CD pipeline ([this file in particular](.github/workflows/codacy-analysis.yml)) would automatically enable Codacy and perform analysis as needed. 
- Codacy also provided us the dashboard to monitor various aspects of the project, including code duplication, complexity, etc. 



Reason to avoid hiding API keys:
Although we had originally wanted to hide our API keys within our codebase, we have concluded that it would be better to direct our efforts else where. Our project has two API keys: Spoonacular and Firebase. In regards to the Spoonacular API we concluded that it would not be detrimental to security to expose this key. Spoonacular is a free public API with only GET capabilities. Upon further research, we found that exposing the Firebase key is not a security risk. This key is an identifier for our database and with our Firebase security rules limiting access to an authenticated userâ€™s own data, there is little risk of abuse. Although we had originally planned to hide these keys out of code practice, we realized that with the time we had sunk into finding a solution as well as our value of simplicity, it would be best to keep our project in its original form of vanilla javascript. This allowed us to redirect our efforts elsewhere rather than spend more time re-working our project to support environment variables.
