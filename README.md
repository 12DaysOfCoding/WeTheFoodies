## Project Description
Our team will design a recipe management application.

## Setup Instructions
1. Get [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have.
2. In the root dir of this project, run `npm install`. This will install [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
3. To run the linter, do `npm run lint`. Only unfixable problems will be reported.
4. To run unit tests, `npm run test`
5. To run e2e tests, `npm run e2e`

## Testing
* We are using a combination of [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) to run tests.
* Jest is for unit tests and puppeteer is for end to end tests.
* Note there is a folder call `/tests` in the root dir. Within this folder, you have one folder called `unit` and another called `e2e`. Each contains an example of how to write a simple test.
