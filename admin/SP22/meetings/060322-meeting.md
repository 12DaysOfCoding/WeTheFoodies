## What we do today:

Wrap up things that we need to do:
- Testing
- Analytics
- Final video/presentation

## Decision:
- E2E testing: will try to add some but the initial plan is to not have E2E tests. Will write a document stating why we don't do that.
- Changing layout to fit with our value, user-focused: responsive display by using @media. Main concern: conflict with testing and onboarding feature. However, since we plan to not have e2e test, conflict in testing should not be much of a concern. For onboarding, changing the layout would (potentially) not affect much.
