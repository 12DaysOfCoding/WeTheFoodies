## Back-end

Database update: using real time database
- Users can create account now
- Still working on forget password feature

## Front-end

- Create delet/edit button - need back-end to help set them up with our database
- Edit feature idea: using the same layout/style ass recipe-add but instead of having a black space, we will load the user data to the fields for user editing.
-  Application is not keyboard compatible, ex: press "Enter" in Add Recipe will result in submiting the recipe rather than entering a new line, <- and -> keys does not work in Foodie Mode
- Create log in / forget password layout

## What we do today:

Decide on an ADR for user account preference.
